February 2013
 I presented a paper at the `Western Regional Science Association Meetings <https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/wrsa/annual-meeting/santa-barbara-preliminary-program>`_ in Santa Barbara, followed by a trip to the `SIAM meetings on Computational Science and Engineering <http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse13/index.php>`_ in Boston where I was part of a session on `Big Data in Python Mini-symposium <http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=15776>`_ organized by `Fernando Perez <http://www.fsf.org/news/2012-free-software-award-winners-announced-2>`_ and `Titus Brown <http://ged.msu.edu>`_. 

January 2013
 PySAL 1.5 is `released <http://pysal.org>`_.

October 2012
 I was honored to be asked to give a keynote at the `Open Source Geospatial
 Research and Education Symposium <http://www.ogrs2012.org/index.php/ogrs2012/ogrs2012>`_ in Yverdon-le-Bains, Switzerland.

 Prior to the OSGRS meetings, I gave a talk as part of the `GIScience Colloquum <http://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/giscience-giva/events/giscience-colloquium>`_ at the Department of Geography, University of Zurich.

September 2012
 We presented an all-day workshop on PySAL at `GIScience 2012
 <http://www.giscience.org>`_ where I also spoke on a panel discussing
 space-time research.


August 2012
 PySAL 1.4 is `released <http://code.google.com/p/pysal/>`_.


July 2012
  I attended the `Joint Statistical Meetings
  <http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2012/index.cfm>`_ in San Diego where we gave two
  papers, one on `Spatial Econometrics in the Age of CyberGIS <http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2012/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=303498>`_ and the other on `CAST <http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2012/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=303861>`_.

  I gave a talk at `SciPy 2012 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2012/talks/index.php>`_ on `PySAL <http://pysal.org>`_. The last SciPy I attended was 3 years
  ago and I think the community has grown by leaps and bounds. There is a lot
  of great work happening with Python and this conference showcases this very
  nicely.

April 2012
  I'm excited to be guest-editing a special issue on
  `Spatial Data Infrastructures, Cyberinfrastructure, and e-Science for GIScience
  <http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/spatial_data/>`_ for the
  *International Journal of Geo-Information*, together with 
  `Michael Finn <http://cegis.usgs.gov/>`_ of USGS.
