Welcome

I am a professor in the `School of Geographical Sciences and Urban
Planning <http://geoplan.asu.edu>`_ 
at Arizona State University.
My research and teaching interests include open source spatial
analysis, spatial econometrics, exploratory space-time data analysis
and regional science. I am the creator of the package `STARS:
Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems
<http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/hsd/hsd_pi_mtg/presentations/rey.pdf>`_
and lead developer of `PySAL: A
Python Library for Spatial Analysis <http://pysal.org>`_.  Much of this work is carried out within
the `GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation
<http://geodacenter.asu.edu/>`_.  On this site you can learn more about
my research, teaching, professional and personal interests.
